## Building the dev environment

Press `Ctrl -> P` 1️⃣ and then `>`and search for `Rebuild`. Select `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`2️⃣. This will essentially mount your code tree inside a docker container and switch the development context of VSCode to be inside the container where all of the python etc. dependencies will be installed.

Once the task is running, a notification 1️⃣ will be shown in the bottom right of the VSCode window. Clicking in the notification will show you the setup progress 2️⃣. Note that this make take quite a while depending on the internet bandwidth you have and the CPU power of your machine.

## Run django migration

```
cd /home/web/project/django_project

## Create super user

```

During this process you will be prompted for your user name (defaults to root), email address and a password (which you need to confirm). Complete these as needed.


## Viewing your test instance
After completing the steps above, you should have the development server available on port 2000 of your local host:
