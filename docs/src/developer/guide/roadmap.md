# Roadmap

Like most Open Source Software, this project is an ongoing work in progress.

This document outlines the various ongoing activities and critical changes 
expected to be introduced.

## Future plans

- A data model for scenarios instead of pulling in google sheets or similar
- More ingestors for risk data
- Hazard data support with auto aggregation of risk factors such as population
  counts etc.
- Single sign on support

## Considerations

The current **main** branch is under heavy development and should be considered
unstable.
