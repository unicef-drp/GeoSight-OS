# The Home Page

![Home Page](img/home.png)

The home page is your first destination when opening GeoSight. It contains a banner and a list of projects to which you have access. The project home page is organised into these areas:

## The Project Gallery 

A project is a collection of indicators, context layers, widgets and filters. These components allow you to understand the operational conditions for a given areas. The projects you have access to may vary depending on whether you are logged in (see 3 below) or not.

## Projects

Each project is displayed in the gallery with:

* a thumbnail representing the theme of the project
* a title for the project
* a short description of the project

If the description overflows the space provided, you can scroll vertically inside the project block to see the additional details.
