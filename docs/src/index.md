# GeoSight

GeoSight is an open-source web geospatial data platform developed by UNICEF for easy data visualization and analysis. It is specifically designed to simplify the creation of online maps for visualizing multiple indicators at a subnational level to support evidence-based decision-making for better results for children. This data is displayed utilizing reference boundaries pulled dynamically from [GeoRepo](https://github.com/unicef-drp/GeoRepo-OS).

## Overview

The GeoSight platform was developed to help UNICEF Country Offices in emergency response and operational planning. It 
harvests and aggregates data linked to administrative areas (e.g. national and subnational boundaries).
These data can then be visualized as choropleth or pie chart maps. Widgets (charts, tables, summaries) can be
displayed in association with the currently active indicator layer.

There are two main interfaces of the platform:

* the dashboard view - this is where end users open and explore data in projects that have been created for them to support their operational work.
* the admin area - this is where projects are designed and data can be managed. Data sources are selected and the reporting areas and components are configured.

## Key Concepts

A **Project** (dashboard) is the most important feature of GeoSight. Projects combine different elements (reference datasets, indicators, and context layers) and enable data visualization/analysis for all end users. 

**Indicators layers** derive from spreadsheets or other intelligence assets harvested by the platform. They visualize specific Indicator(s) on the map, using choropleth method (color-coded boundaries) or charts (pie or bar charts).

**Context layers** are geospatial layers pulled from external web mapping services (ArcGIS Online/Portal, WMS, GeoJSON etc) used to contextualise the information presented in a project.

**Widgets** are visual components such as charts generated by performing data analysis on country/regional levels and the indicator data.
