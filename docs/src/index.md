# GeoSoght

GeoSight is a UNICEF’s open-source geospatial web-based data visualization/analysis platform that aims to make geospatial data easily accessible and sharable in support of risk informed programming. This data is displayed utilizing administrative reference datasets from [GeoRepo](https://github.com/unicef-drp/GeoRepo-OS).

## Introduction

The GeoSight platform was developed to help organisations with operational planning. It 
harvests and aggregates data linked to management areas (e.g. national and subnational boundaries).
These data can then be visualized as choropleth maps. Widgets (charts, tables, summaries) can be
displayed in association with the currently active indicator layer.

There are two main areas for the platform:

* the projects area - this is where users open and explore data in projects that have been created for them to support their operational work.
* the managagement area - this is where projects are designed. Data sources are selected and the reporting areas and components are configured.

## Key Concepts

A **project** (dashboard) is the most important feature of GeoSight. Projects
combine different elements (Reference datasets, indicators, and context layers)
and enable data visualization/analysis for all end users. 

**Context layers** are geospatial layers used to contextualise the information
presented in a project.

**Indicators layers** derive from spreadsheets or other intelligence assets
harvested by the platform.

**Widgets** are visual components such as charts generated by performing data
analysis on country/regional levels and the indicator data.
