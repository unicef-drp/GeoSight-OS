# Contributing to GeoSight

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ˜˜ âœ¨

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project.
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and
feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. Search the list and try reproduce on your
local machine with a clean profile before you create an issue. 
When you create an issue, please provide the following information by filling
in the template.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details
  as possible. Don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it. For
  example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used a
  mouse or a keyboard.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.** Include links to
  files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those
  examples. If you're providing snippets on the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point
  out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the
  described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.

## Suggesting Enhancements

In case you want to suggest an enhancement, please follow this guideline to
help maintainers and the community understand your suggestion.
Before creating suggestions, please check [issue
list](https://github.com/unicef-drp/GeoSight-OS/labels/feature) if
there's already a request.

Create an issue and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the
  suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as
  many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.** Include
  copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code
  blocks.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which helps demonstrate the steps
  or point out the part of project which the suggestion is related to.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users.
* **List some other text editors or applications where this enhancement
  exists.**

## First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking
through these `document`, `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:

* **document issues**: issues which should be reviewed or improved.
* **good first issues**: issues which should only require a few lines of code,
  and a test or two.
* **help wanted issues**: issues which should be a bit more involved than
  beginner issues.
