# GeoSight

GeoSight is a UNICEFâ€™s open-source geospatial web-based data visualization/analysis platform that aims to make geospatial data easily accessible and shareable in support of risk informed programming. This data is displayed utilizing administrative reference datasets from [GeoRepo](https://github.com/unicef-drp/GeoRepo-OS).

## Key Concepts

A **project** (dashboard) is the most important feature of GeoSight. Projects combine different elements (Reference datasets, indicators, and context layers) and enable data visualization/analysis for all end users.

**Context layers** are geospatial layers used to contextualise the information presented in a project.

**Indicators layers** derive from spreadsheets or other intelligence assets harvested by the platform.

**Widgets** are visual components such as charts generated by performing data analysis on country/regional levels and the indicator data.
